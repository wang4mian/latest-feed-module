[Learn more about color tolerancing here](https://formlabs.com/blog/color-accuracy-delta-e/).\n\nColor Resin V5 is custom-manufactured in one week for a time-efficient and cost-effective solution for creating easy and affordable custom-colored SLA parts, including color-coded jigs and fixtures, realistic prototypes, and high-quality end-use parts.\n\n![Image 4: 3D printed water bottle holder in pale pink](https://formlabs.com/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fformlabs-media.formlabs.com%2Ffiler_public_thumbnails%2Ffiler_public%2F9b%2Fda%2F9bda5c66-4c4a-4750-b58b-213921bab801%2F05272025_color_resin_v5_103-edit__no_shadow_store.jpg__1354x0_q85_subsampling-2.jpg&w=3840&q=75)\n\nThe table below gives estimates for the lead time and pricing of producing this prototype water bottle cage for cycling, designed by Albatross Bikes.\n\n| Manufacturing Method | Lead Time | Cost Per Part, Including Labor* |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 3D print in-house with Color Resin V5 | 2-7 days | ~$40 |\n| 3D print in Grey Resin and paint with a custom color in-house | 7-10 days | ~$70 |\n| Outsource to a service bureau, either material jetting 3D printing or painting an SLA printed part | 3-14 days | $250-500 |\n\n_*Labor cost assumes $30/h operator wages._\n\nDesigned for both aesthetics and performance, the mechanical properties of Color Resin V5 are commensurate with General Purpose Resins for Form 4 Series 3D printers, with a small amount of variability depending on the color ordered.\n\nColor Resin V5 can be ordered in quantities as little as one liter. Each order is manufactured on demand with one week of lead time and quality checked to ensure reliable results.\n\n**Color Resin V5 is currently only available in the USA, with expansion to other regions coming in the near future.**\n\n![Image 5: Parts 3D printed in Color Resin V5](https://formlabs.com/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fformlabs-media.formlabs.com%2Ffiler_public_thumbnails%2Ffiler_public%2Fc1%2F7e%2Fc17e9f77-635a-4231-abda-bb3b1521bf80%2Foptimized_for_web_jpeg-05202025_color_resin_v5_255-edit.jpg__1354x0_q85_subsampling-2.jpg&w=3840&q=75)\n\nOrder Color Resin V5 in quantities starting at one liter.\n\nEach order of Color Resin V5 includes a customized Formlabs Print Settings (FPS) file. In PreForm, click the “Download Now” button to login and download the FPS file. Then, insert your resin cartridge and dedicated resin tank in the printer and start printing.\n\nTo [post-process](https://formlabs.com/post-processing/wash-cure/), wash the part in Form Wash for 10 minutes. Then, post-cure at room temperature in Form Cure (2nd Generation) for one minute or Form Cure (1st Generation) for five minutes.\n\nSince the release of Form 1, Formlabs has offered users castable resins. With [Clear Cast Resin](https://formlabs.com/store/materials/clear-cast-resin/), users can print engineering parts over 3 mm thick. Now, True Cast Resin enables users to leverage the speed, accuracy, and reliability of Form 4 Series 3D Printers to create precise, detailed patterns for casting under 5 mm thick. For parts between 3 mm and 5 mm thick, select True Cast Resin for printing intricate or highly detailed parts.\n\n![Image 6: Parts printed in True Cast Resin as well as finished cast parts.](https://formlabs.com/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fformlabs-media.formlabs.com%2Ffiler_public_thumbnails%2Ffiler_public%2F5d%2Fb5%2F5db576cb-9609-4696-bf88-51c7d6b6aa6f%2Foptimized_for_web_png-04232025_truecast_hero_05_depth-edit.png__1354x0_q85_subsampling-2.jpg&w=3840&q=75)\n\nParts printed with True Cast Resin are highly accurate with crisp features, smooth surfaces, and exceptional detail, minimizing post-processing and finishing time.\n\nFormlabs materials engineers applied the feedback from users of previous castable resins to develop True Cast Resin. This new wax-filled material is designed for precision casting of intricate jewelry and complex engineering components.\n\n|  | Castable Wax Resin | Castable Wax 40 Resin | True Cast Resin | Clear Cast Resin |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Applications | Fine filigree, lightweight jewelry, and dental applications | Medium to heavy jewelry and small engineering components | Medium to heavy jewelry, medallions, figurines, and small engineering components up to 5 mm thick | Demanding engineering applications over 3 mm thick |\n| Compatibility | Form 2 Form 3/+ Form 4 | Form 2 Form 3/+ | Form 4 | Form 2 Form 3/+ Form 4 |\n\nParts printed in True Cast Resin have low expansion and maintain surface integrity with no wax migration or residue over time, allowing for a more forgiving casting experience. Low thermal expansion, minimal shrinkage, and 0.03% ash content ensure clean burnout and consistently excellent casting outcomes.\n\n![Image 7: Three frogs with crowns. One is cast, one is printed in True Cast Resin, and one is cast and set with stones](https://formlabs.com/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fformlabs-media.formlabs.com%2Ffiler_public_thumbnails%2Ffiler_public%2F8f%2Fc8%2F8fc81651-3d0c-4ade-b512-593919a8cbc7%2Foptimized_for_web_jpeg-12182024_truecast_hero_026-edit.jpg__1354x0_q85_subsampling-2.jpg&w=3840&q=75)\n\nThis Frog Prince was cast in sterling silver and then set with stones.\n\n1.   Heat resin at 60 ℃ for 45 minutes and shake. Then, insert the cartridge into the printer.\n2.   Once the part is printed, wash in Form Wash for five minutes.\n3.   Dry the part with compressed air.\n4.   Post-cure the part for 3-10 minutes at room temperature.\n5.   Prepare the part for casting by removing part supports, adding sprues, and attaching to a casting tree.\n6.   Burnout and cast the part.\n7.   Rescue part from the cast and clean, de-sprue, and finish.\n\n![Image 8: True Cast Resin Sample Part](https://formlabs.com/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fformlabs-media.formlabs.com%2Ffiler_public_thumbnails%2Ffiler_public%2Fef%2F0d%2Fef0d159c-8a43-4dac-aefe-76cc1943bec9%2Foptimized_for_web_png-05132025_true_cast_samplerevisedhero_102_shadow.png__1354x0_q85_subsampling-2.jpg&w=3840&q=75)\n\nSample part\n\nSee and feel Formlabs quality firsthand.

This precise control of texture generation enables improved aesthetics and functionality on desired surfaces without compromising other critical features in the model, like mating surfaces, snap fits, or holes.\n\n![Image 10: PreForm Screenshot](https://formlabs.com/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fformlabs-media.formlabs.com%2Ffiler_public_thumbnails%2Ffiler_public%2F81%2F11%2F811182ae-ff3a-4c75-b276-f7070ba3436b%2Fimage.png__1354x0_subsampling-2.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nThis setting provides users with a quick and easy option to reduce support touchpoints by 30%. The profile is optimized for fewer touchpoints, cleaner supported surfaces, and reduced post-processing. More challenging geometries may need to be reoriented to avoid print artifacts.\n\n![Image 11: PreForm Screenshot](https://formlabs.com/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fformlabs-media.formlabs.com%2Ffiler_public_thumbnails%2Ffiler_public%2Ff4%2Ffc%2Ff4fc4d9a-46e2-4edc-a9be-70585b95b351%2Fpart_color_coding_sls.png__1354x0_subsampling-2.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nAssign colors to models within a PreForm Build, making them easier to identify on-screen. Colors can be applied to individual models or entire model lists and may be selected manually or randomly generated for all models in the print job.\n\nTo start using these free features, download PreForm or navigate to the Help menu in PreForm and select “Check For Updates.”\n\nThe versatile Formlabs material library spans mechanical properties, applications, and now, a full spectrum of colors. From tough and durable to biocompatible or ceramic, Formlabs resins are optimized to print with precision, accuracy, and speed on Form 4 Series 3D printers — with the aesthetics and performance you require.\n\nAchieve custom colors that blend in or stand out — from vibrant colors to nuanced neutrals — with Color Resin V5, custom-manufactured to order.
